1)Not sure if this is right please correct me if I'm wrong.
	1. O(n) = n
	2. O(n) = n + n^2
	3. O(n) = log(n)
2)The printf line is not valid because the syntax is wrong. There whould also be a default case in case the number inputted its not between 1 and 4.
3)I think this code snippet isn't valid because the i variable isn't defined as a number yet.
