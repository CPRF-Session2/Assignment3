/*Rebecca Hale, Part 2 Assignment 2*/
1.
a. The complexity is n.
b. The complexity is n^2 + n.
c. The complexity is n * n/2.
2.
The code does not do the intended task.  The statement "printf("%d", "Enter number:");" is
an incorrect statement and results in the printing of an arbitrary number.
Instead, the statement "printf("Enter number: ");" should have been used. If this statement
had been written correctly, the code would have repeatedly asked for a number until given 
a number lower than 1 or above 4.
3. 
The code snippet is invalid.  First, the variable i is never declared, so it
is never given a space in memory.  Second, the statement "printf("%d\n");
would result in an error because no integer was attached to the statement.
