The following code will only print the user's number. It will not prompt theuser for another number. This can be fixed by declaring a char 
variable(x). Next, you would have to put the while loop inside a do while 
loop. Before the while in the do while loop, you would have a
printf and scanf statement that asks the user to put in a ceratin char if 
they want to continue or end the program(y or n). The final while will
compare x to the user's input. If its y, the program will run again. If it
is n, the program will end.The %d in the printf statement after the while loop needs to be deleted.

The following code is not valid. The printf inside the for loop doesn't havea variable in it. Besides that, the code is correct as long as i has been 
declared a value outside the for loop.
