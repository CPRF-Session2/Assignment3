1)	a)	n
	b)	n^2
	c)	nlog(base 2)(n)

2)	It does not do this. The loop should look like this:
	while(n >= 1 && n <= 4)
	{
		printf("Enter a number: \n");
		scanf("%d", &n);
		if(n < 1 || n > 4)
		{
			break;
		}
		else
		{
			printf("%d", n);
		}
	}

3)	No; printf("%d\n") needs to have `, i` before the `)`. Also, this only works if i was already initialized and given a value.
